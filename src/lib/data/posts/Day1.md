# Introduction to a system database

Today, I learned about what is a system database.

We use data for everyday life, whether it's a data table, an article, or an image.

## System

    A set of components that work together to achieve something.

## Data

    Facts and statistics that are collected together for reference or analysis.

## Information

    A data that has been processed and converted into another form.
