## What is discrete math

**Discrete math** is a branch of mathematics that deals with countable, distinct, and separate objects rather than continuous quantities.

Discrete quantities are countable and distinct. They take on specific, separate values with no values in between.

Continuous quantities, on the other hand, are not countable in the same way. They can take on an infinite number of values within a range, and there are always values between any two points.

### Key topics

- **Logic and propositional logic**  
  Logic is the study of reasoning and valid argumentation. In discrete mathematics, you'll learn propositional and predicate logic, truth tables, logical equivalences, and rules of inference.

- **Sets and Set Theory**  
  The study of sets and their properties, including operations on sets, set cardinality, subsets, unions, intersections, and set relations.

- **Relations**
  The study of binary relations, equivalence relations, partial orders, and functions.

- **Algorithms and Complexity**  
  The analysis and design of algorithms, including their efficiency, complexity, and common algorithmic strategies.

- **Combinatorics**  
  Counting and arranging objects, covering permutations, combinations, and principles like the pigeonhole principle.

- **Graph Theory**  
  The study of networks represented as graphs, including trees, paths, and graph algorithms.

- **Boolean Algebra**  
  Boolean algebra is a mathematical system that operates on binary variables, which can only have two values: true (1) and false (0). It deals with logical operations and expressions using these binary values

- **Mathematical Induction**
  Mathematical induction is a method of mathematical proof that consists of two steps:

  - Base Case (Inductive Base):  
    In this step, you prove that the statement holds true for a specific starting value, typically the smallest natural number for which you want to prove the statement.

  - Inductive Step:  
    In this step, you assume that the statement holds true for some arbitrary natural number, typically denoted as "k." Then, you use this assumption to prove that the statement also holds true for the next natural number, which is "k+1."

- **Probability**  
  The study of random events and their likelihood, involving concepts like random variables and probability distributions.
- **Group Theory**  
  The study of algebraic structures known as groups, with group operations.

## Propositional Logic Example

### Propositions:

These are statements that can be either true or false, but not both. Propositions are usually represented by letters or symbols.

Examples of propositions:

- p: "The sun is shining."
- q: "It is raining."
- r: "2 + 2 = 5."

### Logical Operations:

- **Negation (¬):**  
  This operation is used to form the negation or opposite of a proposition.

  Example:
  ¬p: "The sun is not shining."

- **Conjunction (∧):**  
  This operation represents the logical AND. A conjunction is true only if both propositions it connects are true.

  Example:
  p ∧ q: "The sun is shining, and it is raining."

- **Disjunction (∨):**  
  This operation represents the logical OR. A disjunction is true if at least one of the propositions it connects is true.

  Example:
  p ∨ q: "Either the sun is shining or it is raining (or both)."

- **Implication (→):**  
  This operation represents logical implication. It expresses that if the first proposition is true, then the second proposition must also be true. However, if the first proposition is false, the implication is still considered true.

  Example:
  p → q: "If the sun is shining, then it is raining (but it can also be true if the sun is not shining)."

- **Biconditional (↔):**  
  This operation represents logical equivalence or if and only if. It is true when both propositions have the same truth value (either both true or both false).

  Example:
  p ↔ q: "The sun is shining if and only if it is raining (both statements have the same truth value)."
