# What is the title?

At first, i don't know how is it or how to do it. So... here it is.

## Diploma vs Sarjana

A diploma is an educational program that focuses on practical skills and theoretical understanding relevant to a specific field of study. 40% theory 60% practice.

A sarjana is a higher education program that focuses on mastering and developing certain sciences, arts and technology. 60% theory 40% practice.

## More Context

SKS = Satuan Kredit Semester  
2 SKS = MKDU (Mata Kuliah Dasar Umum)  
3 SKS = Mata kuliah jurusan teori  
4 SKS = Mata kuliah jurusan praktikum  
6 SKS = Sidang

IP = Indeks Prestasi  
IPK = Indeks Prestasi Kumulatif

### Value Weight

4 = A  
3 = B  
2 = C  
1 = D  
0 = E

## IP and IPK

### IP

IP is an assessment system applied on campus and is the result of adding up all the grades for the courses you complete during 1 semester.

IP Formula: $$Total\ (SKS * Point) \over (Total\ SKS)$$

Example:

| Mata Kuliah                 | SKS | Value | Point | SKS x Point |
| --------------------------- | --- | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| Pengantar Ekonomi Makro     | 3   | A     | 4     | 12          |
| Manajemen                   | 3   | B     | 3     | 9           |
| Praktikum Aplikasi Komputer | 3   | B     | 3     | 9           |
| Akuntansi Keuangan Dasar    | 3   | B     | 3     | 9           |
| Hukum Bisnis                | 4   | A     | 4     | 16          |
| Logika                      | 3   | B     | 3     | 9           |
| Etika                       | 2   | A     | 4     | 6           |
| Jumlah                      | 21  |       |       | 70          |

IP semester = $${{70} \over {21}} = 3,33$$

### IPK

IPK is the result of combining your grades from semester 1 to the final semester. This figure shows the success level of studies at university with the highest score being 4.

IPK Formula: $$Total\ of\ All\ (SKS * Point) \over (Total\ of\ All\ SKS)$$
